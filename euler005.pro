% Problem 5: Smallest multiple
% ----------------------------
% 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from
%   1 to 10 without any remainder.
% What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible (with no
%   remainder) by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
%
% =============================================================================
%
% This problem becomes absolutely trivial if you remember that the least
%   common multiple operation is associative.
%
% Implementation notes:
% - Using 1 as initial value in foldl/4 does not alter the final result.
