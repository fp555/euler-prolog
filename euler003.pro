% Problem 3: Largest prime factor
% -------------------------------
% The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
% What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
%
% =============================================================================
%
% Nothing special about this problem, just straight number crunching. I could
%   afford being somewhat inefficient since the problem number is not huge, but
%   even minimal optimization efforts can have a really high payoff:
%   ?- time(euler003(600851475143,X)).
%   - Before: 55,011,006 inferences, 5.611 CPU in 6.296 seconds
%   - Now: 67,150 inferences, 0.012 CPU in 0.012 seconds
%
% Implementation notes:
% - In divisors/2 I do not really require the divisors list to be sorted, but
%   rather to not have duplicates (and sort/2 is shorter than list_to_set/2),
%   while unfortunately I really do need that stupid append/2;
% - nextprime/2 is what happens when a programmer is too lazy to write multiple
%   similar predicates and too prone to conditional operators abuse :).
