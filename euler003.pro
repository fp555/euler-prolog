% Problem 3: Largest prime factor
% -------------------------------
% The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
% What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
%
% =============================================================================
%
% Nothing special about this problem, just straight number crunching. Good
%   thing the problem number is not huge, because prime factorization is a
%   really inefficient operation.
%
% Implementation notes:
% - In nextprime/2, if a divisor is found (skipping 1) we need not bother
%   trying anything else. Praise failure-driven backtracking!
% - I was forced to use is/2 with floor/1, while using #=/2 inside the
%   negated goal brutally kills performance and I am not sure why.
