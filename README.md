# Project Euler problems in Prolog
Since my Prolog is *not amazing* it's very likely that my solutions will be inefficient, inelegant or both.

Problems will come as I have time to do them, along with some comments. Feel free to ignore them.
### Why Prolog?
- It's a language I like
- It's a language that **makes sense**
- It's a language that makes one strive for maximum elegance and clarity
### Why [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)?
- The problems are challenging and often interesting
- You have to solve the problem before you code. The goal is to always have a clear plan on what to write and what you expect to get back
- Solving the problems as written is fine, solving the general case is better
### Do you want to try Prolog? 
1. Install something like [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html), or embrace the awesomeness of [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/)
